# 0x09. Web infrastructure design
## Details
      By Sylvain Kalache, co-founder at Holberton School          Weight: 1          Project to be done in teams of 3 people                Ongoing project - started 03-08-2022, must end by 03-10-2022 (in about 15 hours)          - you're done with 0% of tasks.      Manual QA review must be done          (request it when you are done with the project)      ## Concepts
For this project, students are expected to look at these concepts:
* [DNS](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/12) 

* [Monitoring](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/13) 

* [Web Server](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/17)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to  [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/Dvn7v5U404zIccrJ_jDevg) 
 ,  without the help of Google :
### General
* You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
* You must be able to explain what each component is doing
* You must be able to explain system redundancy
* Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS
## Requirements
### General
* A  ` README.md `  file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
* This project will be manually reviewed:
* As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
* Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use [imgur](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/QorG0rvw1PzqWBVrqWW6Sg) 
 but feel free to use anything you want). 
* For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file 
* After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box
* You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
* Focus on what you are being asked: 
* Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project
* Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements
* Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you
* In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked

### 0. Simple web stack
          mandatory         Progress vs Score  Task Body A lot of websites are powered by simple web infrastructure, a lot of time it is composed of a single server with a  [LAMP stack](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/lBFrw_pTU3_sMuYFptFFsw) 
 .
On a whiteboard, design a one server web infrastructure that hosts the website that is reachable via   ` www.foobar.com `  . Start your explanation by having a user wanting to access your website.
Requirements:
*  You must use:* 1 server
* 1 web server (Nginx)
* 1 application server
* 1 application files (your code base)
* 1 database (MySQL)
* 1 domain name  ` foobar.com `  configured with a  ` www `  record that points to your server IP  ` 8.8.8.8 ` 

* You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:* What is a server
* What is the role of the domain name
* What type of DNS record  ` www `  is in  ` www.foobar.com ` 
* What is the role of the web server
* What is the role of the application server
* What is the role of the database
* What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website

* You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:* SPOF
* Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)
* Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic

Please, remember that everything must be written in English to further your technical ability in a variety of settings.
